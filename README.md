## Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing
- Verify your route ID is correct for heavy trash
- Check the API URL for trash collection
- Ensure you have internet connectivity
- Check Home Assistant logs for error messages

### Calendar Not Working
- Restart Home Assistant after installation
- Verify the calendar integration is enabled
- Check entity states in Developer Tools

### Heavy Trash Route Not Found
- Double-check your route ID format
- Verify the route exists in the [Houston Heavy Trash Dashboard](https://mycity.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/cb0ac86b3b434513b5f22428385820f3)
- Route IDs are case-sensitive

### FWS Sensors Not Updating
- Verify sensor IDs are correct (numeric values like 582)
- Check that the sensor exists on the [Harris County FWS website](https://www.harriscountyfws.org)
- Some sensors may be temporarily offline for maintenance
- Check Home Assistant logs for HTTP errors

### FWS Data Parsing Issues
- The FWS website may have changed its format
- Check the integration logs for JSON parsing errors
- Try removing and re-adding problematic sensors
